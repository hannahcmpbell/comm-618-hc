## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Step 1: Load necessary packages (optional)
# install.packages("readr")  # Uncomment if you haven't installed readr
library(readr)

# Step 2: Read the CSV file
data <- read_csv("Homeless_Service_Facilities.csv")

# Step 3: Check the structure of the data (optional, to verify column names)
str(data)

# Step 4: Count how many facilities have "Yes" in the CASE_MANAGEMENT column
case_management_yes <- sum(data$CASE_MANAGEMENT == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE)

# Step 5: Print the result
cat("Number of facilities with case management service:", case_management_yes, "\n")

```
```{r}
# Step 1: Filter rows where CASE_MANAGEMENT is "Yes"
case_mgmt_facilities <- data[data$CASE_MANAGEMENT == "Yes", ]

# Step 2: Display facility names
case_mgmt_facilities$PROGRAM_NAME
```
```{r}
# Filter for facilities with CASE_MANAGEMENT == "Yes" and no NAs
case_mgmt_facilities <- data[data$CASE_MANAGEMENT == "Yes" & !is.na(data$PROGRAM_NAME, ]

# Display the facility names
case_mgmt_names <- unique(case_mgmt_facilities$PROGRAM_NAME)
print(case_mgmt_names)
```
```{r}
# Filter for facilities with CASE_MANAGEMENT == "Yes" and remove NA values in both columns

# Print the list
